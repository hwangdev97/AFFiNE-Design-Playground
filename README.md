# AFFiNE-Design-Playground


> This project is a tool for AFFiNE's product design to find the best practices for AFFiNE UI/UX. We will write some prototypes at the code level here, which may or may not appear in AFFiNE's official products.
> The code here may be delivered as a reference for development, so in terms of implementation, we will tend to use native CSS to achieve effects, without being limited by frameworks, making it clearer for other dev colleagues to read.
> Finally, many prototypes are not perfect, and as product designers, we will not be overly concerned with code implementation. The content is for reference only.
